## Overview
This project aims to analyze employee attrition within an organization by examining HR data. The goal is to identify key drivers of employee turnover and provide actionable insights for improving employee retention, optimizing workforce planning, and enhancing overall organizational efficiency.

## Objective
- Determine the overall attrition rate and identify key factors contributing to employee turnover.
- Provide insights based on employee demographics, job roles, compensation, and performance data.
- Develop strategies for retaining talent and reducing attrition.

## Scope
- **Attrition Analysis**: Calculate the attrition rate, identify patterns, and explore factors influencing employee turnover.
- **Demographic Insights**: Understand how age, gender, and education level impact attrition.
- **Role and Compensation Insights**: Assess how job roles, departments, and salary influence attrition.
- **Performance Insights**: Analyze the correlation between employee performance and attrition.

## Data Insights
1. **Attrition Trends**:
   - High attrition rate in certain job roles (e.g., customer service, sales).
   - Younger employees (18–25) have higher turnover rates, often due to seeking career growth or better opportunities.
   - Frequent business travel correlates with higher attrition due to work-life balance challenges.

2. **Demographic Insights**:
   - Employees in mid-career stages (26–35) tend to stay longer due to family stability and career focus.
   - Gender disparities in attrition rates may highlight potential gaps in workplace policies or culture.

3. **Compensation Insights**:
   - Employees with lower compensation levels tend to have higher attrition rates, signaling potential dissatisfaction.
   - High performers with competitive pay are more likely to remain in the organization.

4. **Performance Insights**:
   - Higher attrition is seen among low-rated performers, potentially due to dissatisfaction or terminations.
   - Targeted retention programs for employees with average performance ratings could be effective in improving retention.

## Key Deliverables
1. **Attrition Report**: 
   - Detailed analysis of attrition rates, contributing factors, and departmental breakdowns.
   
2. **Visual Dashboards**: 
   - Visual representation of attrition trends by department, role, and demographic.
   
3. **Recommendations**: 
   - Actionable strategies tailored to specific insights aimed at improving retention and organizational efficiency.
